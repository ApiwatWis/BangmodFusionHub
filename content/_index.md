# 👋 Hello & Welcome!

A very warm welcome to **Bangmod Fusion Hub**. Whether you are a student struggling with physics equations, a teacher looking for teaching materials, or just someone curious about what an "Artificial Sun" actually is... **you have come to the right place.**

At KMUTT ("Bangmod"), we believe that advanced science like nuclear fusion shouldn't be accessible only to experts. We created this space to break down complex topics into clear, easy-to-understand concepts.

# 🔭 What's Inside?

Think of this website as a central notebook that gathers key knowledge, including:

* **⚡ Plasma Physics 101:** From the basics of "What is plasma?" to Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) made simple.
* **🍩 Tokamak Devices:** Deep dives into machines like **TT-1 (Thailand's first Tokamak)** and the massive international project, **ITER**.
* **💻 Simulation & Code:** Learn how to write Python code to simulate plasma behavior (perfect for Computational Physics students).
* **🛠️ Diagnostics:** Real-world measurement tools and techniques used in actual research.

### 🚧 Note: Work in Progress
